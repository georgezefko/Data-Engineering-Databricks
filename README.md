# Data-Engineering-Databricks

This repository aims to demonstrate how to use Databricks for your data engineering projects. Keep in mind to run few of the projects you will need premium account in Databricks since the free community one comes with certain limitations.

Repository structure

**.devcontainer**: This directory contains all the files and scripts necessary to set up the local dev environment and interact with Databricks from VScode.
